1. Code builds Yelp search URL and uses Yelp API Key to fetch data.
2. By assigning a value to the 'term' in every function, the code can narrow down search results to what is required.
3. Code gets the expected result count and loads data into a pandas data frame which can be exported as a CSV file.
4. This CSV file can then be used to make data visualizations
